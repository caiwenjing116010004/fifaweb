It aims at Designing a FIFA website with an integrated data management system. Tools we use to implement this system include Python3, Flask,  Jinja, MySQL, Bootstrap, jQuery, HTML, JS and CSS. You can follow this document to set up the environment by yourself. You can also go to the website demo to directly access our project. If you have any problem, feel free to raise issue.

## Setting up the environment

1. Setting up the virtual environment. The system is currently developed with Python3. Please make sure that the Flask, Pymysql is properly installed in the `virtual environment`. Refer to <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/#virtual-environments>

   **Under the path: xxx/GitHub/fifaweb** 

   - For Linux and Mac:

     ```
     mkdir myproject
     cd myproject
     python3 -m venv venv
     . venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - For Windows:

     ```
     py -3 -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

2. Install dependency packages in virtual environment:

   ```
   pip install Flask
   pip install pymysql
   pip install cryptography
   ```

3. To simplify development, create a mysql database called 'photo'. **[for now: skip the step]**

   ```
   CREATE DATABASE photo;
   ```

4. When log in mysql as root, create a  user 'photodev' and grant privilege.**[for now: skip the step]**

   ```
   CREATE USER 'photodev'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '123456';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON photo.* TO 'photodev'@'localhost';
   ```


For Linux and Mac:

```shell
. venv/bin/activate
export FLASK_APP=fifa
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

For Windows cmd, use set instead of export:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
set FLASK_APP=fifa
set FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

For Windows PowerShell, use $env: instead of export:

```powershell
$env:FLASK_APP = "fifa"
$env:FLASK_ENV = "development"
flask run
```

If you want to use your computer as a local server, you need to run flask using this command:

```shell
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --with-threads
```
Then you need to check your IP address in LAN
The main page should be on

```http
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## MySQL Connection 
(For Prof. Lee and TAs)
```
Hostname: 106.54.207.45
Port: 3306
Username: erg2
Password: 12345678
```
Note: This user only grants SELECT privilege on our database fifadata.
